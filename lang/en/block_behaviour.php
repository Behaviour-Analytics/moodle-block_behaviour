Behaviour Analytics considers all the activities on a course page as nodes in a graph. The links between nodes are the student accesses of those activities. Each student then has a centroid point derived from their accesses to activities and the coordinates of the nodes. The student centroids can be clustered to group students and find common access patterns. The nodes of the graph can be manually positioned and/or removed from the graph, which will affect the student centroids. When students create new data for the system, the clustering results get updated and can be replayed to visually verify the grouping remains correct with the addition of the new data. Incorrect groupings can be manually altered. The plugin is intended for teacher use and will not be seen by students.';
$string['docshowset'] = 'How to change global settings.';
$string['docssettings'] = 'The plugin contains some global settings that affect what a user sees when they use the program. There is an option to allow the students to see their study IDs and to show student names in the graphing menu rather than sequential numbers. If the LORD plugin is installed, there is an option to allow integration with it. The settings also give the option to grant or revoke the role of researcher to any non-student user enrolled in a course the plugin is installed in. The researcher role allows the user to see the current graph configurations and clustering results of other users in that course. The researcher can only see another user\'s data, they can not change it. The settings can be accessed as administrator from Site administration -> Plugins overview, then searching for "Behaviour Analytics" and clicking the associated settings link.';
$string['docshowtask'] = 'How to use the scheduled task.';
$string['docstask'] = 'The block has a scheduled task that is, by default, set to run once a day. The frequency that the task runs can be changed by going to Site administration -> Server -> Scheduled tasks, then clicking the settings icon for "Update Behaviour Analytics." From here, it is also possible to run the task manually.';
$string['docshowview'] = 'How to view the student behaviour graph and run clustering.';
$string['docsview1'] = 'If the resource nodes are not configured prior to viewing the graph, the nodes are given automatic positions. The view interface consists of the graph, a menu of student groups, a menu of students, and a time slider. The group and student menus allow selection of which students to view on the graph. The time slider allows selection of which links to view. All users have their time start at access 1, so not all students will have links at the far end of the time slider. The two handles control the slice of time that is viewed. Hovering over a node will produce the name of the associated resource and a preview of the activity in an interactive window. Moving the mouse outside the preview removes it.';
$string['docsview2'] = 'There is a button labelled "Cluster" above the student menu that moves from the graph viewing stage to the clustering stage. Clicking the button will show the same graph and student links, but with each student centroid denoted by a triangle. There are two radio buttons at the bottom left that determine the centroid type, which are weighted geometric (default) and decomposed. The slider in the clustering interface controls the stages of clustering. Moving the slider to the second position removes the graph and scales the student centroids to the edge of the viewing area. The third position on the slider allows clustering to be performed. A text box takes the number of clusters to use or the default of 3 will be used. The k-means clustering can then be stepped through one iteration at a time with the step button or it can be played to convergence by using the play button. The reset button will reset the clustering stage, clearing the current clustering results. All the clustering results are logged in the right side panel, which shows which cluster each student belongs to.';
$string['docsview3'] = 'During clustering, student centroids and clustering centroids can have comments added to them. Clicking a centroid will bring up a comment box to record any notes about the cluster or its members. Hovering over a student centroid will show that student\'s graph. Hovering over a clustering centroid will show a graph of common links among members of that cluster. Unlike the student graph, the common links graph will remain visible until the mouse is clicked outside the graph. While the common links graph is visible, hovering over a node will produce a preview of that node and hovering over a link will produce previews of both nodes attached to that link.';
$string['docsview4'] = 'During clustering, it is also possible to assist the clustering algorithm by dragging and dropping student centroids. When a student centroid is dragged away from its original location and dropped elsewhere, the clustering centroid closest to where the student was dropped will have that student included in the cluster. This feature can assist the clustering algorithm when its results are not quite what is desired based on the user\'s perception of the visualization. The clustering algorithm will still need to run again and may override the manual clustering at this point.';
$string['docshowconfig'] = 'How to configure the resource nodes.';
$string['docsconfig1'] = 'The interface includes the graph of all course activities, a weight slider, and a hierarchical legend of the nodes. Researchers will also have a menu of the other user\'s graph configurations which they can view, but not alter. The weight slider controls the link weights where positive values produce nodes that pull together and the negative value will push the nodes apart. A value of zero causes all the nodes to remain stationary. The nodes can then be dragged into position. Unwanted nodes can be removed by right clicking and choosing the remove option or by unchecking the associated box in the hierarchical legend. Hovering over a node will show the type and name of the activity as well as bring up an interactive preview. Moving the mouse outside the preview makes it disappear.';
$string['docshowreplay'] = 'How to replay clustering results.';
$string['docsreplay1'] = 'If no clustering has been done, only the interface is shown. The interface consists of a menu of clustering runs sorted by user, graph configuration, and clustering run. Selecting an item from the menu will bring up the same graph shown at the onset of clustering. The play and step buttons control the replay and determine which iteration is seen. The replay can be stepped through forward or back, but can only be played forward. Clicking a centroid will allow notes to be added or viewed if any comment was made for that centroid during clustering.';
$string['docsreplay2'] = 'When a clustering run has used the full time slice of the time slider and also run to convergence, that clustering run will be updated with new student data when it is available. This updating will change student centroids, add iterations to the replay, and can alter the cluster membership. Using decomposed centroids causes the centroid to align on a node and can make the student centroid highly mobile. Geometric centroids tend to move less as there is more data.';
$string['docsreplay3'] = 'Manual clustering is possible during the replay, but behaves slightly differently than during clustering. Once the replay has reached initial convergence, student centroids can be dragged and dropped to place them in another cluster. The manual clustering produces a second set of clustering centroids that are the same colour as the originals. The original set is unchanged while the manual clusters are more transparent and represent the changes the user has made. Both sets of clusters are updated with new data as it is available.';
$string['docshowimport'] = 'How to export and import data.';
$string['docsexport'] = 'Teacher users will see an "Export" button to export a complete anonymized data set, which will export everything the plugin has, but change all student IDs to their study IDs. Additionally, administrator users will see export and import forms in the block which are used to export or import student resource access data. The export form has two check boxes, one for currently enrolled students and the other for previously enrolled students. Clicking the export button allows the data to be downloaded. Exporting can also be done through Moodle\'s reports interface by navigating to Site Administration -> Reports -> Logs. Pick the course to export for and set the actions to "View", then click the "Get these logs" button. Once the logs are retrieved, scroll down to the bottom of the page and download the logs as a JavaScript Object Notation (.json) file. Exporting from the command line is also possible by running the export-cli.php script located in the cli directory. Running the script without parameters will show a usage message.';

With the administrator option enabled, an extra link will appear in the block to configure the integration. There are 2 settings available from within the block. The first causes Behaviour Analytics to use the latest graph made in the LORD plugin. The second switches between using the system generated graph and the user manipulated graph. If there is no LORD graph to use, the graph made with Behaviour Analytics will be used instead.

$string['docslord2'] = 'When using the LORD generated graph, it is possible to manipulate the nodes using the "Configure resource nodes" feature. The graph will appear slightly different, as it will have grouping nodes and their associated links. If a LORD graph is manipulated within Behaviour Analytics, it will cease to be a LORD graph.

The clustering data is what is made when viewing and clustering students. This includes the clustering and membership data, as well as comment data. The graph configuration data is made when positioning the graph nodes. Deleting this data removes all graph configurations for the course as well as student centroid data associated with those graph configurations.

Note that changing the default surveys may invalidate the current scoring functions for those surveys. The link in the surveys menu can be used in a URL type course module to give students access to the survey. Currently, a student may only take a survey once. When viewing survey responses, it is possible to download the shown data as a CSV file. Viewing the results of with the ILS or BFI surveys will show radar charts of the respondents data.

Turning on the LSA feature will run LSA on each student\'s data and combine the results to determine which nodes are the most important and the strength on the links between those nodes. This node and link data will be used to configure the graph. When LSA is on, it will override using the LORD graph and also generate a new graph everytime. To use the same graph multiple times, turn on the LSA, generate a graph, then turn LSA off. As long as LORD is not being used, the latest LSA graph will be shown.';

The Behaviour Analytics plugin must be installed and set up for the PSG plugin to work. The PSG plugin can either use the ILS questionnaire results or the clustering analysis results. Using clustering results involves generating at least one clustering analysis and selecting it for use in prediction. When replaying clustering, there is a checkbox at the bottom of the analysis to select for prediction. Only an analysis that has run to convergence can be selected for prediction. Regular, LORD, or LSA graphs may be used in prediction. Once an analysis is selected, the PSG plugin will use the selected analysis to perform learning style prediction based on the cluster that the student belongs to and the common links in that cluster. Each node in the common link set has its learning style determined and summed to determine the learning style of the cluster. The learning style of the course learning objects is also determined and then the objects are arranged based on their relevance to the student\'s predicted style.';
