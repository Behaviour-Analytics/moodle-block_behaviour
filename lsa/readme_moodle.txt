The Lag Sequence Analysis Tool in PHP in available from
https://github.com/pulipulichen/lag-sequential-analysis-tool-php. There is no
version information and the code was last updated in 2019. The original file
had to be latered to work with arrays instead of strings. Everything needed
to generate as LSA graph in Behaviour Analytics is included, which is only the
base class file. The rest of the original package was excluded.

To upgrade to the latest version (which may or may not break existing code),
download and replace the lsa/sequential_analysis.class.php file. Then, update
the thirdpartylibs.xml file with the latest version number.
